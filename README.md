# Targeted Marketing, Case Study Introduction
## You've just been hired as a junior data scientist for Banco Federal de Finan√ßas in Aveiro, Portugal. 
## They just finished a major telemarketing campaign and management was not happy with the results.
## They feel like machine learning could help them create a more targeted campaign. 
## You and your team have been brought in to discuss the situation.
# Focus areas
## Finding interesting customer segments based on their previous marketing campaign.
## Finding a way to identify the types of customers most likely to respond favorably to future marketing campaigns.
## Proving to a skeptical Senhor Ferreira that a targeted campaign based on data science will significantly outperform a campaign made up of randomly selected customers.
## We were given the task to build a model based on the results of the previous telemarketing campaign to help identify the different types of customers that would respond favorably to any future marketing campaigns. Specifically, we were tasked to create a machine learning model to identify customers who were more likely to say yes to signing up for a term deposit.
